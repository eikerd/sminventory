The "Smart" Spreadsheet Layout
The view is shifted from a grid to a high-density table with a focus on visual health indicators.
1. Header & Filter Bar
Search: Stays pinned at the top left.
Quick Filters: Add pill-shaped toggles next to the search: [All] [Missing Models] [Not Scanned] [Ready to Run].
Global Actions: "Scan All" and "Download Missing" buttons moved to the top right.
2. The Smart Columns
Column	Type	Why it’s "Smart"
Selection	Checkbox	Allows for bulk scanning or bulk downloading.
Workflow Name	Text (Primary)	Includes a small icon indicating the workflow type (e.g., Image, Video, Upscale).
Health Status	Icon + Tooltip	A color-coded dot: <br>🟢 Ready: All dependencies present.<br>🟡 Incomplete: Models missing but scanned.<br>⚪ Unknown: Not yet scanned.
Dependency Progress	Progress Bar	Instead of "0/3", a slim horizontal bar that fills as models are found. Tooltip shows the specific missing model names.
Missing	Badge	A high-contrast amber badge (e.g., ! 8) that only appears if models are missing, drawing the eye to problems.
Total Size	Data Value	Right-aligned, auto-formatting (B, KB, MB, GB). Grayed out if 0 B.
Last Scanned	Timestamp	"2 hours ago" or "Never." Helps track if data is stale.
Actions	Icon Group	Clean icons for View (Eye), Scan (Refresh), and Download (Cloud). These only reveal full color on row hover to reduce visual noise.
3. Visual Concept (Mockup Description)
The Aesthetic:
Background: Deep matte black (#0d0d0d).
Rows: Separated by very thin, dark grey borders. Row highlights on hover with a subtle purple glow (matching the "Sminventory" brand).
Typography: Monospace font for "Size" and "Missing" counts to ensure perfect vertical alignment.
Example Rows:
[ ]	Workflow Name	Health	Dependencies	Missing	Size	Actions

4. Smart Functional Improvements
Conditional Formatting: If a workflow has "Missing Models," the text for that row turns slightly more amber. If "Ready to Run," the name turns bright white.
Inline Scan: Clicking the "Scan" icon triggers a small loading spinner inside the cell, updating the "Health" and "Dependencies" columns in real-time without refreshing the page.
Expandable Rows: Clicking the workflow name drops down a small sub-panel listing every required model and its individual status (Found / Missing / Downloading).
Sticky Header: The column headers stay at the top as you scroll through your 24+ workflows.
